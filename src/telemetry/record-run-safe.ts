/**
 * Translates a finished agent run into the single telemetry event and records
 * it. This is the one bridge between the run lifecycle and telemetry:
 *
 * - Chat is dropped (it is interactive and would emit an event per turn), so
 *   only init and update ever produce an `openwiki_run` event.
 * - The agent's output mode is mapped to the brain `mode`.
 * - The setup fields (mode, provider, connectors) are attached on **init only**
 *   (the configuration moment); updates omit them.
 * - The `--telemetry-file` tee target is forwarded through.
 *
 * Like {@link recordRun}, it never throws.
 *
 * @param command - Which run lifecycle finished. Only init/update are recorded.
 * @param options - The run options; read for `outputMode` and `telemetryFile`.
 * @param facts - What the run produced: its `outcome`, the failure diagnostics
 *   (`errorClass`, plus an optional `errorDetail`, `errorOwner`, `errorStage`, and
 *   `httpStatus`, all present only on failure), and the resolved `provider` (which
 *   may be undefined when resolution failed before the provider was known).
