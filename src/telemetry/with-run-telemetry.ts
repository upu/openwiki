 * the agent itself) is recorded exactly once, closing the pre-agent coverage holes
 * where a throw previously reached no telemetry. On a clean return it records the
 * outcome the agent published on `ctx` (defaulting to "success"); on a throw it
 * records "failure" with the anonymous diagnostics from
 * {@link describeErrorForTelemetry}, then rethrows so the CLI still owns the failure
 * UX. It never throws from telemetry: `recordRunSafe` swallows its own errors.
 *
 * @param command - Which run lifecycle this is. Only init/update are recorded; chat
 *   is dropped downstream by `recordRunSafe`.
 * @param options - The run options; `recordRunSafe` reads `outputMode` and
 *   `telemetryFile` from them.
 * @param ctx - The mutable context the wrapped `run` enriches (provider, outcome).
 * @param run - The run to perform and record: setup, connectors, and the agent.
